This Concrete Strength Analysis project applies fundamental deep learning techniques to predict the strength of concrete. Using a publicly available tabular dataset, two Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were built: one using the Sequential model and the other using the Functional model. The project involves preprocessing the data, training the models, and evaluating their performance. Additionally, a detailed analysis of the training results is conducted. The models are designed to predict concrete strength, demonstrating the application of basic deep learning concepts for real-world problem-solving.
